SMART Goals Research:
A smart goat is a goal that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

Resume Improvements:
* I can use 2 columns on my resume to add more to the resume while looking professional.
* I can add projects that I did even if they were not specifically for work.

Job Posting & Evaluation:
* [Neumeier Engineering](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=f48e289587befe3c&q=programming&l=Seattle%2C+WA&tk=1i83u06njiq5g880&from=web&advn=3741103686702885&adid=434135770&ad=-6NYlbfkN0CWc-Yg9zuMg5T3QuS8x1o3LRmuGvgAmF8nLotzj8Rq5MS3hA0MmzKtdt0c1b7FahCWaJgGlPj65j0rq1QsUSgo3PYiqDimy0ZbkpuBOzoXw8AFrYBF8z-toUSz6_J-2ekUdzm4RGXrQkiO4BYKVGmQrK80BqY-HyFxlUDh47D67dftpucWU47sIvYzJOEP76MaKEaHoE227KfGoFlakIijSh9NcPBLsCLcK9HDFVcC1aeHqLMwoqZ576-_QoCb3XRyT7uDPQG0vqEk2SZhvTZfB8gi03j_c-ao_9pLnBkk7mBSpjRFGhqw83MEr0RioXMbBIP_PM5ouW-TNBkNoeJC8s8YWOcNiBZbYHLNm-cioWawVNemctAMXWRqDP7rCzQjI3li6RbXicdyj8dKB-y1xvhIs6oCp1yPX6mIBWdtDp2oGZFpSG3kT8GW5sKC6dIe4art0uPiYPOu04geMxosgjIELn9A0AeOA2_cae2KMEmcztQVwVe85g4-f4CqqgeMtE08CUJJEENzHhWEGN6O&pub=4a1b367933fd867b19b072952f68dceb&camk=nUmJqO2E8rhrVFZCnlSErA%3D%3D&xkcb=SoDg6_M37D0PB7Qv3Z0LbzkdCdPP&xpse=SoA06_I37D0NZ_QUjh0IbzkdCdPP&xfps=d35a8503-f909-4ef5-9bdb-8b1f4ac62fee&vjs=3)

  I liked this one because it has areas of SQL which I really enjoy programming in and would like to learn more about.
  
* [Terex Corporation](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ac711ceee0254bfd&tk=1i83u06njiq5g880&from=serp&vjs=3)

  I liked this job because I like javascript and problem solving. There is also growth in the company in the description.
  
* [Amazon.com LLC](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=60a4fc68f1345841&tk=1i83u7s04jli4801&from=serp&vjs=3)

  Amazon is usually a fast paced learning area. It would show me the world of programming fast, trial by fire (sounds fun). I also have experience with AWS which I will assume they use.
  
Equivalent: what elements of the jobs are equivalent to what you already know? Equivalents could be languages, skills, CASE (computer-aided software environments, i.e., IDEs), tools, or techniques
* I unintentionally already answered this.

Improvements: What elements do you think you could find out and learn about? (example could be domain knowledge, software, Third-party packages)
* I have seen learning nodeRed which I see sometimes on job postings so learning that might be helpful.
* I could learn machine-learning better since I see it on job listings a lot.

SMART Goals: From the previous task, Job Posting & Evaluation, identify a common thread of Improvements. Include a list of classmates that you looked at. (For example: What are some standard search engines? What makes a good match? What equivalent comparisons of languages, tools, and techniques? What are we missing?)
* The main thing that I seem to be missing is experience, which they want for entry level jobs for some reason.

Two S.M.A.R.T. Goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time), one based on what you learned from your fellow classmates, and one from job search.
* I would like to learn more about using github and understand everything that we use on a daily basis.
* Whatever language we program our project in I would like to understand every part of it and learn if there are any ways to improve it.
